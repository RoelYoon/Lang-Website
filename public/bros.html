                Sometimes you show so much of my spirit that I think that you may be a reincarnation of me (or that I may be a reincarnation of you). 
                
                Even after so many projects, I'm more than excited to start another one with you. 
                You've taught me so much
                <br><br>
                Yours,
                <br>
