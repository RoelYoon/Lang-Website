            <h2>
                You may live on the other side of the world, but I feel the closest to you in so many other ways.
                No matter how much I look for it with other people around me, what we have is a special kind of intimacy that 
                can't really be captured between anyone else. 
                I've tried to ignite that spark over and over with anyone I would talk to, but they say it's "boring" or "a headache," politely remarking "I see how that <i>might</i> be fun" or giving a half-hearted "that's cool" at best.
                No one just gets it like you doâ€”the <i>art</i> of coding.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes you show so much of my spirit that I think that you may be a reincarnation of me (or that I may be a reincarnation of you). 
                
                Even after so many projects, I'm more than excited to start another one with you. 
                You've taught me so much
