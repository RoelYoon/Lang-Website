            <h1>Dear Gym Bros,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>With all my heart, I am the happiest when I am with you guysâ€”my dear bros.
                Never would I have thought that I would be so lucky as to have a group of people who understand me to this level.
                You guys helped me build strength both mentally and physically. 
                There is no way that I could have consistently developed like this by myself.
                When I go to the gym with you guys I feel like theres an invisible force thats pushing me to do 
                better, not just to look good, but because I am able. I never realized the mental aspect of working out 
                until I met you guys. I wasnt able to reach some of my goals because I didnt have a group of people 
                like you who gave me perspective. Were all just trying to get fit and healthy, and I know I can come to 
                you guys with a problem if need be.
                I love you guys a lot, and Iwant to say thank you for everything.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                Roel
