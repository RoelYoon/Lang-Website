            <h1>Dear XC/TF Bros,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Sometimes in this world there are sports you do together and sports you do alone, 
                I always thought cross country and track were my alone sports, where I could just
                do my thing and focus on me. That ate away at me a bit. Running can only get you so far 
                until you start to hit a wall and doubt that you can get any better. Then I met you guys. 
                I started opening myself up to you and realizing that track and cross country dont have to 
                be alone sports, they can be individual but with the support of your teammates. While my 
                abilities have improved, the real gift of meeting you guys was getting an amazing group of 
                people who I can see almost everyday afterschool and on weekends, and still not get sick of. 
                I have learned to be patient with myself because you have shown me patience. I have learned 
                to value my accomplishments because you have celebrated my achievements. I have learned to 
                believe in myself because you have cheered me on. Thank you for this, you have shown me love 
                that I want to show to you, I just dont know how to express it.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                Roel
            </h2>
