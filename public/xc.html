            <h1>Dear XC/TF Bros,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>
                There's always been a moment in every season while I am at the very limit of my physical endurance that I think to myself,
                <i>I never want to experience this again</i>.
                <br><br>
                But, as you know, I always come back the next season, ready to endure it all again. I don't come back for the shin splints, medals, plaques, pins, or, really, even for the sport. 
                The feeling of winning is nice, but if that were all there was to it, I wouldn't have returned after my first "K".
                The only thing that makes these sports worth it is you. 
                <br><br>
                You've given me more laughter and endurance than anybody else.
                Even when we're under those hellish weathers during practice or when we're shivering under our jacket-blankets at those post-sundown meets, I'm able to smile, knowing I'm making the most memorable moments of my life because I am with you. 
                Even in those times when I feel as if I couldn't possibly smile at all, you somehow manage to lift my lips, lightening everything.
                And when it seemed like there was just too much and I said I couldn't endure anymore that one night, you promised me, "we'll get through it together."
                <br><br>
                We really have been through it together. We must have ran 50 marathons at this point. 
                Not every moment was a high. Actually, most of it was straight-up painful. 
                But I would do it all over again, and I <i>will</i> do it over again next year...
                as long as you are there. 
                <br><br>
                To many more miles (and shin splints),
                Roel
            </h2>
