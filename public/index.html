            <h1>Dear Gym Bros,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>With all my heart, these have been the most profound few months of my life.
                Never have I thought that I would be so lucky to have a group of people who understand me to this level.
                On both a mental and physical level, you guys have contributed to the development of my strength. 
                When I used to spend my time alone in the gym, it was simply a way for me to escape my thoughts and 
                create a world where I was in control of everything. That got lonely sometimes. While I was able to 
                focus on myself I had no one to share my accomplishments with who understood it the sake way I do. 
                Now when I go to the gym with you guys I feel like theres an invisible force thats pushing me to do 
                better, not just to look good, but because I am able. I never realized the mental aspect of working out 
                until I met you guys. I wasnt able to reach some of my goals because I didnt have a group of people 
                like you who gave me perspective. Were all just trying to get fit and healthy and I know I can come to 
                you guys with a problem if need be.
                I love you guys a lot and I want to say thank you for everything.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                Roel
