            <h1>Dear Shaila,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Happy birthday!!! I know we haven't been perfect... but we're still together, and I'm happy about that.
                I think the "mature" lesson we're all supposed to learn is that life takes us any place, and we rarely
                have a choice in whether we want to play along. The tides of our lives keep pulling us apart, and it really
                feels impossible to stay together sometimes, doesn't it? But every time the waves came, I've held on: I would 
                remember your kindness, your pretty voice, your sacrifices and work for me. And, somehow, you've held on
                for me all this time as well. So, throw away "maturity" as I've always taught you! We'll defy
                life's big moral lesson and decide where to go in life together. 
                <br><br>
                Remember all the places we've beenâ€”they're the best places I've ever been in my life, and I don't want us to stop.
                And here's how you know we won't stop: I swear to God that we will go all these places here someday, camp out and wait
                for nighttime, and stargaze and make out. They'll be the best places we'll ever be.
