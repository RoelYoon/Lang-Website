            <br>
            <h2>
                Good habits usually don't stick around for me. 
                I've really tried, but it seems at this point that I'll always be a procrastinator, vegeyable avoider, and everything else I fight not to be.
                That is how powerless I am alone.
                Eventually I become worn out and fall, and I just stay there on the ground unable to push myself back up.
                <br> <br>
                It was the same story when I began working out for the first time—I fell (only after a few days at that), and I was ready to stay there.
                The dream of having the Flash's or the Rock's jumping pecs was sseemingly about to be thrown onto the pile of abandoned instruments and failed video game projects. 
                But this is when I met you, gym bros. 
                <br> <br>
                You first started as my actual brother
                You just wouldn't let me get lazy, making sure I'm following the hard variants on those T25 videos even on my worst days.
                More importantly, you wouldn't let me give up. 
                Monday or Saturday, you would even drag me out of bed for those daily workouts.
                When I fell, you pulled me right back up.
                <br> <br>
                You have changed faces over the years, but your spirit has always stayed the same—supportive, inspiring, and proud. 
                You're the first to cheer for my new lift records and the one to push me through the rough patches.
                It's miraculous to see how far I've come with you by my side as you remind me every time I beging to doubt my place.
                Everything I've achieved in the gym seemed so impossible just a few years ago. 
                Well, truthfully, they might as well have been actually impossible: I could never have gotten to where I am without you. 
                <br> <br>
                You have changed me forever. 
                You have let me achieve impossible goals, despite how weak I am alone. 
                You have made me strong. Thank you.
                <br><br>
                When I stand in front of a mirror, I will always see you by my side. 
                <br><br>
                Flexing my hardest,
                Roel
            </h2>
