            <h1>Dear Coder Bros,</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>You are the people that I can hang out with everyday and not get bored. 
                When I grow old and forget everything else, you will be the thing I remeber.
                I cant imagine what my life would be like without you and I dont want to have to. 
                Its difficult to make friends, hard to find good ones, and even harder to keep them, 
                but you have stuck with me through thick and thin and theres no possible way for me to 
                repay you for that. I smile when I think of our memories together and look forward to making new ones. 
                You are not only the funniest people i know but also the most caring and sensitive friends I could ask for. 
                Though we pass our time doing simple things, the happiness that I feel from knowing you're my friend is 
                compounded and full. Theres no worries or doubts about having to act a certain way, just ease and joy. 
                I often worry about pushing people close to me away, but I would never think about trying to push you 
                guys away because you are too important. You have taught me camaraderie, and humor and so much more and 
                I will forever love you and be greatful to you.
                <br><br>
                Sincerely,
                Roel
